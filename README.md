# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a secondary code challenge for the MWT Web Team. The purpose of this challenge is to be able to aggregate data
from multiple sources into one view. This project uses the `https://developer.marvel.com/docs` public api and is using a
public key. You can get more information about the data structure and queries by accessing the documentation.

On the detail page for each comic listed there is currently a text listing for each character in the comic. We would
like to change that to be a small card. This card would contain a thumbnail, the characters name, and a count of the
available series and comics.

This project is using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. If there is another system you'd prefer to use, by all means do so.

This challenge isn't meant to take a long time. We recommend not spending approximately 30 minutes to an hour to complete.

Fork the `main` branch on github and we can talk through your completed results on our follow-up call.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
